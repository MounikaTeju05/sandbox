   <p> Hi, I'm Mounika Teju.<br />
    <strong>Designer. Product Person.</strong>
    Multidisciplinary designer who hacks at, makes and occasionally breaks things.
    Less moody in real life. ✌️ </p>
    <p><h2> <a id="About">About</a></h2></p>
    <p> I build value by design.
        I’m Monika Teju, but you can just call me Teju.
        Originally hailing from the UK 🇬🇧 for the last decade or so I’ve been honing my skills in design, production and management roles building products for the web, mobile, games and, more recently, VR & AR.
        I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical dependencies in mind for implementation, scalability and developer sanity.
        
        I’ve worked with small, agile teams on skunkworks projects and larger development teams with product lifecycles spanning multiple years.
        
        Depending on the team, resources and deliverables I’ve worn many hats over the years - holding titles like Product Designer, UI Designer, UX Designer, Front-end Developer, Growth Lead, Producer, Product Manager & Product Owner.
        
        I also occasionally give talks on design and product development.</p>
